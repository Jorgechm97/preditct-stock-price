# Stock Data Analysis Project in Python with Machine Learning

This Python project focuses on data analysis using tools such as pandas, matplotlib, and yfinance to obtain and visualize information about stock prices, perform statistical analysis, and apply machine learning techniques to predict prices.

## Description

This project uses historical stock price data from the PriceSmart company to perform analysis and visualization over time. Additionally, a machine learning model is applied to predict future PriceSmart stock prices.

##Functionalities

1. **Monthly and Semi-Annual Stock Analysis:** The adjusted prices of PriceSmart shares are analyzed at monthly and semi-annual intervals.
2. **180-Day Moving Average:** The 180-day moving average of PriceSmart stock is calculated and displayed.
3. **Linear Regression and Predictions:** A linear regression analysis is performed and stock price predictions are generated using machine learning.
